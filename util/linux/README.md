# linux

__.config__ my current linux kernel configuration file for `make menuconfig`.
Copy / link it to `linux-xlnx/.config`.

__zynq-zed.dts__ my current device tree.
Copy / link it to `linux-xlnx/arch/arm/boot/dts/zynq-zed.dts`.

All the other stuff are applications which are supposed to run on the zedboard.
